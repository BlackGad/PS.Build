# PS.Build: Toolchain to control msbuild process via C# code
Build process with [MSBuild](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0k6kkbsd.aspx) engine is powerful and simple. Current toolchain allows developer to extend and adapt his project build process using inline C# code via [Attributes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa288454(v=vs.71).aspx).

## Usage
Build process extending have 2 logical parts 
*	Attribute definition
*	Adaptation applying

Attribute definition looks like generic C# attribute definition with additional ```DesignerAttribute("PS.Build.Adaptation")``` attribute and several implemented methods with specific signature. Available methods:
* ```void PreBuild(IServiceProvider)``` - called before build. Here you can analyze MSBuild environment before build. Also gives the opportunity to add additional generated MSBuild items.
* ```void PostBuild(IServiceProvider)``` â€“ called after build. Here you can setup deploy, clean etc tasks with generated items.
To execute defined earlier instructions you must add reference to PS.Build.Tasks nuget package and apply attributes to relevant elements. NOTE: attribute definition must be in separate assembly. Same assembly attribute definition not implemented yet (Technically it is possible but whole build process time will be dramatically increased). 

## How it works
[PS.Build.Tasks nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PS.Build.Tasks/) contains [MSBuild task](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t9883dzc.aspx) which uses [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) engine to analyze target assembly source code for adaptation attribute usage prior to compilation.
### Process flow
1.	[PreBuildAdaptationExecutionTask](https://github.com/BlackGad/PS.Build/blob/master/PS.Build.Tasks/Tasks/PreBuildAdaptationExecutionTask.cs) depends from [ResolveReferences](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29231077/what-exactly-does-the-target-resolvereferences-does-in-msbuild) target so has as input paths to all assembly references (compiled libraries)
2.	References scan for adaptation attributes definitions
3.	Assembly source code analysis for adaptation attributes usages (fast [syntax tree analysis](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Getting-Started-C%23-Syntax-Analysis))
4.	If there is no suspicious attributes task break processing.
5.	Otherwise suspicious attributes [semantic analysis](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Getting-Started-C%23-Semantic-Analysis).
6.	Attributes instantiating
7.	All **PreBuild** methods definition call.
8.	Artifactory artifacts content generation analysis
9.	Extend MSBuild with additional items
10.	Code compilation
11.	[PostBuildAdaptationExecutionTask](https://github.com/BlackGad/PS.Build/blob/master/PS.Build.Tasks/Tasks/PostBuildAdaptationExecutionTask.cs) execution after code compilation
12.	All **PostBuild** methods definition call in attributes instances instantiated in 6 step
